This project is a fractal simulator.
You can input a custom fractal by passing the function, starting value, bound, and number of iterations.

To run:
```
make
./fractol						# Gives more information on how to use it
./fractol "z*z+p" 0 "|z|<=2" 50	# Displays the Mandelbrot fractal with 50 iterations
```
